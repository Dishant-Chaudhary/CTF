### 📝 Description

> "I love to take photos of this land of beauty and write short reflections on my impressions across different platforms.

### 🧠 Initial Thoughts

- The phrase **“Switzerland of Asia”** commonly refers to **Kashmir**, but the challenge might intentionally mislead.
- We were provided an image named `beautiful.png`, likely a scenic photo.
- The reference to multiple platforms and navigation suggested we needed to **track the image or author** across the internet.

### 🔍 Investigation & Approach

1. **Reverse Image Search**  
   - I used reverse image search tools like Google Images and Yandex.
   - Searched using keywords like:  
     `"Switzerland of Asia"`, `"Switzerland of India"`, `"Zwique"`, and `"beautiful scenery Asia"`.

2. **Found Match on Pinterest**  
   - After ~5–10 minutes, I found the **exact same image** on a Pinterest post.
   - Scrolled through the **comments** on that post and noticed a suspicious link.

3. **Followed the Trail**  
   - The comment mentioned:  
     `"Zwique Spectacular Landscapes... Altai Tavan Bogd..."`  
   - It contained a **Pastebin URL**:  
     [`https://pastebin.com/HvCVgscd`](https://pastebin.com/HvCVgscd)

4. **Retrieved the Flag**  
   - Opened the link and found the flag in plain text.

### 🏁 Flag

### 🌍 Background

- The flag refers to **Altai Tavan Bogd**, a national park in Mongolia.
- The challenge title was likely a red herring — it’s not Kashmir or India, but **Altai Mountains** in Central Asia.
- The name means “Five Holy Peaks of the Altai,” and the tallest peak is Khüiten Peak (4,374m).

---

### 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Reverse image search** is a powerful OSINT technique — especially when combined with platform-specific searches like Pinterest or Instagram.
- Comments, image descriptions, and hidden links can often lead to the answer.
- Challenges may deliberately use **geographic or cultural misdirection** to make you overthink.
- Never ignore seemingly small clues in captions or usernames.
